# JSCharting
some experiments with JS charts as I continue to learn javascript
As I took on the startig bits on javascript from freeCodeCamp, the first weekend I practised a small tutorial on JSCharts by Arthur Puszynski
The bonus challeng was very basic but it was fun to explore and I thought of keep coming back to the project and experiment more with JSCharts. Putting the files and updating the progress on GitHub is a way to explore both, GitHub and JSCharts.
